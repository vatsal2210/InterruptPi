As PIR sensro detetcs as event mailer.js file call and sendEmail trigger.

You can learn how to use sensors with Raspberry Pi and Node Js. On the trigger event how to call other JS file. 
Here I called mailer.js file and use SendEmail function to send Email to the user when interrupt is detected.

I used the WhatsMate API to send message on telegram and whatsapp also. Any message you can receive on your phone when any event is trigger.
